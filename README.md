# Django Bookstore Management System

## Overview

This is a Bookstore Management System implemented using Django and Django REST Framework. The system allows users to perform CRUD operations on book information, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting books. User authentication is implemented using JWT tokens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django REST Framework

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kavin-create/Bookstore-Management-System-.git
    ```
    

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd bookstores
    ```

### Running the Django Server

To start the Django server, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Accessing the Bookstore API

After starting the Django server, you can access the Bookstore API. Here are some key endpoints:

- **Login:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/login/` (POST request with username and password)
- **Add a new book:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/` (POST request with book details)
- **Retrieve all books:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/` (GET request)
- **Retrieve a specific book by ISBN:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/by-isbn/{isbn}/` (GET request)
- **Update book details:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/{id}/` (PUT request with updated book details)
- **Delete a book:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/{id}/` (DELETE request)

### Authentication

The API requires authentication using JWT tokens. To obtain a token, use the login endpoint. Include the obtained token in the Authorization header for protected endpoints.
